# CV-Data-Extractor
A simple Python Scripting project which extracts:
1) Names
2) Phones
3) Emails
4) A set of Skills given by the user from a set of given CVs.
   
Then constructs a CSV file containing these extracted Data.
This was done by using Python libraries like re, spacy, os, sys, and pandas.
